			<!-- An image was inserted, centered, and a border was added to it. Rounded corners were then added, to the image and the border. The width and height attributes were included, even though they were not used, because some browsers need them to hold space for the image. An alternate to the image was provided, in case of link error or for users with disabilities. -->
