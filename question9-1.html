				The Boston Americans were dubbed the Boston Red Sox in 1907 after a uniform change made red the official team color. Players wore red socks, so naturally the decision to change the team name was a simple one.

				<br/>
				<br/>

				However, the owner decided that “SOCKS” didn’t look good when spelled out on a jersey, so he shorted it to just “RED SOX” with the six letters evenly split down the middle.

				<br/>
				<br/>

				The strangest part of this story is that the original Boston Red Stockings were actually a different team. You may now know them as the Atlanta Braves.
